Eden Deployment Tools
---------------------

There are 2 options currently:

1.  Manual Scripts
- this is the system currently used by the core developers & most likely to work smoothly

2.  Ansible Playbook
- this system is currently out of date but being worked on with a view to it becoming the mainstream approach
